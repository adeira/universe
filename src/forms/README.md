**Designed to speedup development of backoffice forms and their maintenance.** The idea is simple: specify what fields do you want to render, fill them however you want (probably from GraphQL via [`useFragment`](https://relay.dev/docs/api-reference/use-fragment/)), let the form collect user inputs and finally map them back to the GraphQL mutation inputs however you want. This gives us flexibility (query and mutations doesn't have to be related or have any special requirements) and clean interface (you only specify what goes in and what goes out).

**Simple by design.** Do not expect any super advanced things. Simplicity is one of the main distinction from the competitive solutions. You can do advanced things in your code giving you immense flexibility in what's possible. Instead, we focus on a solid base interface that just works.

**Closely integrated with Relay queries/mutations/fragments.** TKTK

**Closely integrated with FBT for translations.** TKTK

**Embracing HTML5 forms.** We are not trying to reinvent a wheel here. The design of these form elements is very similar to how HTML works including commonly known validation attributes. You should be able to prototype the form very quickly if you familiar with HTML forms. Solid Flow types are a big help in case you forget.

**Support automatic form persistence (Recoil).** TKTK

**No magic.** It won't try to create a form based on the GraphQL mutation inputs. It won't automatically fill the default values from your GraphQL query. You are in charge.

Example:

```js
export default function ExampleForm(props) {
  const product = useFragment<ProductEditFormData$key>(
    graphql`
      fragment ExampleFormData on Product {
        id, revision, name, price
      }
    `,
    props.product,
  );

  return (
    <FormRoot>
      <FormMultiUpload
        name="images"
        accept="image/jpeg,image/png"
        label={<fbt desc="form field name for product pictures">Product pictures</fbt>}
      />

      <FormText
        name="name"
        required={true}
        value={product.name}
        label={<fbt desc="form field name for product name">Product name</fbt>}
      />

      <FormNumber
        name="price"
        required={true}
        min={0}
        value={product.price}
        label={<fbt desc="form field name for product price">Product price</fbt>}
      />

      {/* â€¦ */}

      <FormSubmit
        mutation={graphql`
          mutation ExampleFormMutation($productData: TKTK!) {
            productUpdate(productData: $productData) {
              ...ExampleFormData
            }
          }
        `}
        variables={(formValues) => ({
          // map collected form values to GraphQL mutation
          productData: {
            id: product.id, // values from GraphQL query
            revision: product.revision,
            name: formValues.name, // values from the form
            price: formValues.price,
          }
        })}
        onCompleted={() => {
          // See: https://relay.dev/docs/api-reference/use-mutation
        }}
      >
        <fbt desc="edit product form submit button title">Save changes</fbt>
      </FormSubmit>
    </FormRoot>
