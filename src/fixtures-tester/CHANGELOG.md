# Unreleased

# 1.0.1

Note for all Flow users: all projects in [`adeira/universe`](https://github.com/adeira/universe) now use implicit exact Flow types (`{}` for strict objects and `{ ... }` for open objects, syntax `{||}` is deprecated). We do not expect any issues as long as you are using `exact_by_default=true` Flow option.

- Fix failure on unexpected subfolders, see: https://github.com/adeira/universe/pull/2257

# 1.0.0

Initial release.
