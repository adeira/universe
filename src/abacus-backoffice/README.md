```bash
ANALYZE=true yarn workspace @adeira/abacus-backoffice build
```

# Deploying

Deployments are currently manual and waiting to be automated. Run the following command from `adeira/universe` root to deploy to Vercel:

```bash
vercel deploy --prod src/abacus-backoffice
```

# Running in Docker

It's certainly possible (and recommended) to run the Next.js application directly. However, in production, it runs in Docker. You can do the same if you want:

```bash
(cd src/abacus-backoffice && docker build --progress=plain . --tag abacus-backoffice)
docker run -p 5001:5001 abacus-backoffice
```
