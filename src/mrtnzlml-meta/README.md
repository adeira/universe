# Hi, I am Martin

I am fullstack JavaScript developer at Kiwi.com. Unfortunately, I do not have fixed team so I am usually somewhere around **GraphQL**, **React (Native)** or any other **JS** project.

## My location

I am officially part of Prague or Barcelona office but I prefer to spend time in Barcelona. I am basically never in Brno HQ. I also [travel a lot](https://nomadlist.com/@mrtnzlml) and therefore, I prefer solving every issue remotely if possible.

## Meetings, Slack

I genuinely don't like meetings. Luckily, I don't have that many meetings. I am trying to attend only valuable ones. Please always prepare an agenda for the meeting in advance so we can prepare well. I dislike when I am leaving the meeting without clear outcome and I feel like I just wasted my time there. Outcome from every meeteng should be written somewhere. Wanna chat? Let's do it during coffee break instead! :)

Very similar rules applies to how I use Slack. I am following zero inbox philosophy and I read everything. Therefore I don't follow every channel and I am leaving and joining channels frequently (depending on my needs and interests). Don't take it personally when I leave the channel.

## Miscellaneous

_I am an introvert._ That means I loose energy when I am around other people for too long and I recharge my energy by spending time alone. Sounds weird? Check this video to understand my view: https://www.reddit.com/93u8rj/

_I have my moods._ I am fine in one minute and then I am suddenly completely different person. I think it's related to my introversion when things simply went too far too quickly. I am working on that.

_I have my focus zone._ Usually, when I am working really hard. I can be in this zone for a long time (hours). And I need some time to get back. I am usually not very friendly during this recovery period becuase I am still partially in the zone. I am trying to learn how to switch these mods more quickly. Be patient with me, please.

_I want to have things under control._ This way I do things really well. Also, it gives me possibility to say NO when I think it's not OK. I am very unhappy when someone treats me as yet another programmer-monkey.
