# Unreleased

Note for all Flow users: all projects in [`adeira/universe`](https://github.com/adeira/universe) now use implicit exact Flow types (`{}` for strict objects and `{ ... }` for open objects, syntax `{||}` is deprecated). We do not expect any issues as long as you are using `exact_by_default=true` Flow option.
