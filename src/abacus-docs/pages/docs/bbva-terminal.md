Here you can find some general information regarding our payment terminal.

## How to restart the terminal

It might happen that the terminal is not accepting payments because of "Fallo de conexi√≥n". In that case you have to restart the terminal. Follow these steps:

1. press both "." and yellow "Corregir" until the terminal turns off
1. wait until the terminal turns off and press/hold green button to turn the terminal on

The whole process takes a few minutes (especially the startup), be patient.
