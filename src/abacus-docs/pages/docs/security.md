We take security in KOCHKA Café very seriously. For this reason, this is one of the most important documents. Breaking rules described in this document will not be taken lightly.

## Social engineering

This is probably the most common attack vector in our café. The goal of social engineering is usually to get some information that is normally not publicly available.

The rule of thumb is simple here: **Do not share any information that is not already public.**

Examples of social engineering attacks:

- Hi, Martin told me to fix your cameras. I did some changes to our system so everything should be fine now. Are you cameras working OK?
