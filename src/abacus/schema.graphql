    The read-only `revision` value should be used as a pre-condition for mutations, to avoid
    "lost update" situations when editing the product. That is, if a client fetches a product
    from the server, modifies it locally (but with the `revision` value untouched) and sends it
    back to the server to update the product, but meanwhile the product was changed by another
    operation, then the revisions do not match anymore and the operation is cancelled by the
    server. Without this mechanism, the client would accidentally overwrite changes made
    to the product without knowing about it.

    When an existing product is updated or replaced successfully, our database will create a
    new revision value. From a user perspective, there is just one single product revision
    present per different `key` at every point in time. There is no built-in system to
    automatically keep a history of all changes done to a product and old versions of a
    product can not be restored via the `revision` value.
