## Native modules

- React Native Navigation (https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation)
- Mapbox maps (https://github.com/react-native-mapbox-gl/maps)

## Must Have

- ðŸš§ running on Android because Latam is mainly for Android (currently not available)
- âœ… running on iOS
- ðŸš§ possibility to use the application without any login
- ðŸš§ actions (pre-order, create) possible only after account creation
- ðŸš§ dark mode (https://reactnative.dev/docs/usecolorscheme)
- âœ… translations via FBT

## Nice to have

- Relay Experimental with hooks (needs React Suspense release)
- mainly SDUI (Server Driven UI) via `@match` and `@module`, but not everywhere (needs finished Relay support?)
- Relay `@defer`
- Relay Rust Compiler
- Recoil

Cleanup aka _nuke everything_ (when something goes wrong):

```text
(cd src/ya-comiste-react-native/ios && rm -rf Pods)
(cd src/ya-comiste-react-native/ios && pod cache clean --all)
(cd src/ya-comiste-react-native/ios && pod install)

watchman watch-del-all
yarn workspace @adeira/ya-comiste-react-native start --reset-cache
```
