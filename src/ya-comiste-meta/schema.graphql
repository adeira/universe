    This function accepts Google ID token (after receiving it from Google Sign-In in a mobile

    because every user with a valid JWT ID token will be either authorized OR registered and
    authorized. Invalid tokens and disabled tokens will be rejected.

    Repeated calls will result in a new session token and deauthorization of the previous
    token (if it exist). Original session token is returned back only once and cannot be
    retrieved later (it's irreversibly hashed in the database).
