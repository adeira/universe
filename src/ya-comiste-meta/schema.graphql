    This function accepts Google ID token (after receiving it from Google Sign-In in a mobile

    because every user with a valid JWT ID token will be either authorized OR registered and
    authorized. Invalid tokens and disabled tokens will be rejected.

    Please note: repeated calls will result in error since we cannot authorize the user twice
    and we cannot return the previous token either (since it's hashed).
