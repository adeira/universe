This package contains the graphql code used by the [adeira-example-relay](https://relay-example.adeira.now.sh/). You can check out the [playground](https://relay-example.adeira.now.sh/api/graphql).

You probably don't want to use this package directly, it is only intended to be used by the example-relay application.
