Chrome Extension adding small enhancements to Rossum's SA team:

- shows `schema_id` annotations on the annotation screen
- adds `devFeatureEnabled` toggle

To publish: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole

Ideas for improvements:

- add UI warnings when schema best practices are broken (how?)
