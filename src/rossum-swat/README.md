**Welcome to the judgement-free zone!**

This repository contains outputs of the (SA) SWAT activities.

The solutions here are supposed to be quick and dirty. Fast and ugly scripts that do the job are valued **significantly more** than beautiful or optimized code. Tests are not expected or even wanted.

Consult individual scripts in `/src` on how to use them.
