# Adeira Universe

[![Adeira logo](/src/docs/static/img/logo-banner.png)](https://adeira.dev/)

This project is an open-source fork of some _public_ projects created when we worked together in Kiwi.com. We are friends helping each other to build libraries and applications and effectively share knowledge and work among all of us.

[![Continuous Integration](https://github.com/adeira/universe/workflows/Continuous%20Integration/badge.svg)](https://github.com/adeira/universe/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Continuous+Integration%22)

## What can you find here?

- [relay](/src/relay) - Relay Modern GraphQL client with flow support, query logging, stored operations or support for uploadables
- [fetch](/src/fetch) - isomorphic fetch with retries and timeout
- [graphql-bc-checker](/src/graphql-bc-checker) - utility to test your schema against accidental breaking changes

... and more, see READMEs of individual packages located in `/src`. <!-- TODO put there link to adeira.dev: "and more, check out adeira.dev" -->

:point_right: Check out our Relay [demo app](https://relay-example.adeira.now.sh/) and its [source code](https://github.com/adeira/relay-example) to see how it works together :point_left:

## Quick start

```text
git clone git@github.com:adeira/universe.git
cd universe
yarn install
```

Please note: you have to use Yarn. It won't work with NPM!

## Monorepo structure

Overall picture of this monorepo:

```text
/
├── .github/
│   ├── workflows/                        # global GitHub CI job definitions
├── .yarn/
│   └── releases/                         # Yarn itself
├── flow-typed/                           # external Flow types definitions
├── node_modules/
├── scripts/                              # support scripts for this monorepo
├── src/                                  # all the source codes
│   ├── fetch/
│   ├── js/
│   ├── relay/
│   └── .../
├── .eslintrc.js                          # global Eslint config
├── .flowconfig                           # global Flow config
└── package.json                          # global workspaces definition
```

As you can see we store all the code of this monorepo in `src` folder which contains additional subfolders for each project. You will spend most of the time there. Tools like Eslint and Flow (+ the whole testing system) is defined globally for everyone.

Notes:

1. We require you to install Yarn version 1.0+ but the actual version used when working with Universe is defined in `.yarnrc` and it's stored in `.yarn/release`. Your local Yarn version us just an initial executor for the actual Yarn.
1. Flow typed folder is our code as well (even though it's generated by some tool). This means that if the definitions are not OK then fix them just like you'd write any other source code.
