# Adeira Universe

This project is an open-source fork of some _public_ projects created when we worked together in Kiwi.com. We are friends helping each other to build libraries and applications and effectively share knowledge and work among all of us.

## Monorepo

Overall picture of this monorepo:

```text
/
├── .github/
│   ├── workflows/                        # global GitHub CI job definitions
├── .yarn/
│   └── releases/                         # Yarn itself
├── flow-typed/                           # external Flow types definitions
├── node_modules/
├── scripts/                              # support scripts for this monorepo
├── src/                                  # all the source codes
│   ├── fetch/
│   ├── js/
│   ├── relay/
│   └── .../
├── .eslintrc.js                          # global Eslint config
├── .flowconfig                           # global Flow config
└── package.json                          # global workspaces definition
```

As you can see we store all the code of this monorepo in `src` folder which contains additional subfolders for each project. You will spend most of the time there. Tools like Eslint and Flow (+ the whole testing system) is defined globally for everyone.

Notes:

1. We require you to install Yarn version 1.0+ but the actual version used when working with Universe is defined in `.yarnrc` and it's stored in `.yarn/release`. Your local Yarn version us just an initial executor for the actual Yarn.
1. Flow typed folder is our code as well (even though it's generated by some tool). This means that if the definitions are not OK then fix them just like you'd write any other source code.
