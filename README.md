## Quick start

```bash
git clone --depth=100 git@github.com:adeira/universe.git
cd universe
corepack enable

chmod +x ./x
./x install
./x --help
```

_Please note: you have to use Yarn. It won't work with NPM!_

What now? There are many projects under [`src/`](/src) and all of them are tested and linted together (with many monorepo optimizations). You can try to run all the checks using our executor:

```bash
./x
```

It runs only the necessary checks based on what changed last. This monorepo is divided into many workspaces. You can access commands of each workspace like so:

```bash
yarn workspace @adeira/sx-design storybook
```

Specific workspace names can be found in individual `package.json` files of each workspace.

_Do you need some help? Feel free to [ask](https://github.com/adeira/universe/discussions). :)_
