# Adeira working group meeting 25.01.2020

## Attendees

- Martin
- Trond
- Michal

## Issues review

- we should not use issues as a backlog, better to use GH Project for this.

## Relay hooks

- still in experimental, tightly coupled with React suspense that's experimental as well.
- we don't want to push experimental stuff on production.
- we will wait for Relay and React features to be at least in `next` stage.

## DX

- some packages exported from monorepo can have minor issues when used in fresh projects (missing dev dependency, expect code committed to the origin, etc)
- some of these issues are not simple to fix
- it's good enough to mention known edge case issues in the readme file.
- it's recommended to try packages in freshly created projects to catch these kinds of issues.

## Yarn 2

- version 2 just released.
- we will wait probably for 2.1 when community catches.

## Misc

- Next meeting in February.
