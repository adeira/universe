## Can Relay compiler show warning when a deprecated field is used?

It was possible but the API was changed and now it would require a lot of work. We can hope the compiler written in Rust will have a better API.

Workaround - remove the deprecated field from a schema, run the compiler, check errors.

## Fork [`graphql/graphql-relay-js`](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-relay-js/pulls) repo

We are missing features, e.g. Flow explicit inexact types. PRs are not being reviewed. It should be no problem to have it in our monorepo.

## Adeira.dev

Jarda did zero but is willing to change. Let's hope his new working environment will have a positive effect.

## How is the Coronavirus affecting us?

No big changes actually, everyone already could work from home. Due to the virus now everyone is remote, that's the best setup for meetings. All hands is now every week.
